# HAR-Flutter-ML-App  
### Human Activity Recognition using Flutter & Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
HAR-Flutter-ML-App is a mobile application designed to perform **real-time Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** using **IMU sensor data**. The app identifies daily human activities such as **walking, running, sitting, and standing** by leveraging a **Machine Learning model** integrated with a **Flutter-based mobile interface**.

The project demonstrates the practical use of **Machine Learning, Mobile Development, and Sensor Data Processing** to build an intelligent and responsive system.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Flutter** – Mobile application development  
- **Python** – Machine Learning model development  
- **IMU Sensors** – Accelerometer & Gyroscope data collection  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** – Activity classification  
- **WebSocket Communication** – Real-time data exchange  
- **GitHub** – Version control and project hosting

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. IMU sensors collect real-time motion data.
2. Sensor data is transmitted to the backend using WebSocket.
3. The Python-based ML model processes the data.
4. Predicted activity is sent back to the Flutter app.
5. The app displays the recognized activity to the user in real time.
